## Description

CV manager for creating and editing Cvs made with Laravel and Bootstrap.
Base css template taken from templated.com.

User can view, create, edit and delete CVs from database. Home page has listed all CVs currently in database. 

## Project setup

Copy .env.example file to .env on the root folder.

Open your .env file and change the database name (DB_DATABASE) to whatever you have, username (DB_USERNAME) and password (DB_PASSWORD) field correspond to your configuration.

```
npm install

composer install

php artisan key:generate

php artisan migrate

php artisan serve
```

## ToDo Improvements
- More sections should be added to CV (achievements, etc..)
- Controller should be refactored to minimize duplicate code in edit/create.
- Adding tests.
